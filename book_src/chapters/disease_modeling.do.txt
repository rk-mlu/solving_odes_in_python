Throughout this book we have focused entirely on *solving* ODEs, and
we have not spent much time considering the origin of the equations or
what they may be used for. In the present chapter we focus on  
*modeling* with ODEs, by considering a very famous and widely used class
of ODE models that describe the spread of infectious diseases. 
This group of models provides a good example of how a very complex phenomenon
can be modeled with relatively simple systems of ODEs. We will derive the
models from a set of fundamental assumptions, and discuss the limitations
that result from these assumptions. Although we only consider one phenomenon 
and one class of models, the fundamental steps of the modeling process are
quite generic, and can be applicable for a wide range of real-world phenomena.

======= Derivation of the SIR model =======

We want to model how infectious diseases spread in a population. This is a topic 
of obvious scientific and societal interest, which has been studied by scientists
for centuries and, for obvious reasons, received enormous attention in recent years. 
The classical model for predicting the dynamics of an epidemic was derived 
by Kermack and McKendrick cite{SIR1} in the early 1900s, and is referred to as the SIR model,
since it describes the three categories Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (or, alternatively, Removed). 
The spread of disease in a population is a very complex process, and in order to derive 
an ODE based model we need to make a number of simplifying assumptions. The
most important one is that we do not consider individuals, just the total population
and the number of people that move between the three categories. The
population is assumed to be perfectly mixed in a confined area, which means that we
do not consider spatial transport of the disease, just temporal evolution. The first
model we will derive is very simple, but we shall see that it can easily be extended to
models that are used world-wide by health authorities to predict the
spread of diseases such as Covid19, flu, ebola, HIV, etc.

In the first version of the model we will keep track of the three categories of people
mentioned above:
 * _S_: susceptibles - who can get the disease
 * _I_: infected - who have developed the disease and can infect susceptibles
 * _R_: recovered - who have recovered and become immune
We represent these as mathematical quantities
$S(t)$, $I(t)$, $R(t)$,  which represent the number of people in each category.
The goal is now to derive a set of equations for $S(t)$, $I(t)$, $R(t)$, and then
solve these equations to predict the spread of the disease.

To derive the model equations, we first consider the dynamics in a time interval
$\Delta t$, and our goal is to derive mathematical expressions for how many
people that move between the three categories in this time interval. The key part of
the model is the description of how people move from $S$ to $I$, i.e., how
susceptible individuals get the infection from those already infected.
Infectious diseases are (mainly) transferred by direct interactions between
people, so we need mathematical descriptions of the number of interactions
between susceptible and infected individuals. We make the following assumptions:
* An individual in the $S$ category interacts with an approximately constant
  number of people each day, so the number of interactions in a
  time interval $\Delta t$ is proportional to $\Delta t$.
* The probability of one of these interactions being with an infected person is
  proportional to the ratio of infected individuals to the total population, i.e.,
  to $I/N$, with $N=S+I+R$.
Based on these assumptions, the probability that a single susceptible person
gets infected is proportional to $\Delta t I/N$. The total number of
infections can be written as $\beta SI/N$, for some constant $\beta$, which represents 
the probability that an infected person meets and infects a susceptible person. The value
of $\beta$ depends both on the infectiousness of the disease and the behavior of the population,
as will be discussed in more detail below. The infection
of new individuals represents a reduction in $S$ and a corresponding gain in $I$, so we have
!bt
\begin{align*}
S(t+\Delta t) &= S(t) - \Delta t \beta \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N} ,\\
I(t+\Delta t) &= I(t) + \Delta t\,\beta \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N} .
\end{align*}
!et
These two equations represent the key component of all the models considered
in this chapter. They are formulated as *difference equations*, 
and we will see below that they can easily be transformed to ODEs. More advanced models are typically derived by adding more
categories and more transitions between them, but the individual transitions are
very similar to the ones presented here.

FIGURE: [../chapters/figs_ch5/SIR0, width=800 frac=0.8] Graphical representation of the simplest SIR-model, where people move from being susceptible ($S$) to being infected ($I$) and then reach the recovered ($R$) category with immunity against the disease.

We also need to model the transition of people from the $I$ to the $R$ category.
Again considering a small time interval $\Delta t$, it is natural to assume that
a fraction $\Delta t\,\nu$ of the infected recover and move to the $R$ category.
Here $\nu$ is a constant describing the time dynamics of the disease.
The increase in $R$ is given by
!bt
\[ R(t+\Delta t) = R(t) + \Delta t\,\nu I(t),
\]
!et
and we also need to subtract the same term in the balance equation for $I$, since
the people move from $I$ to $R$. We get
!bt
\[ I(t+\Delta t) = I(t) + \Delta t\,\beta S(t)I(t) -\Delta t\,\nu I(t) .
\]
!et

We now have three equations for $S$, $I$, and $R$:
!bt
\begin{align}
S(t+\Delta t) &= S(t) - \Delta t\,\beta \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N}
label{SIR1:S}\\
I(t+\Delta t) &= I(t) + \Delta t\,\beta \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N} - \Delta t\nu I(t)
label{SIR1:I}\\
R(t+\Delta t) &= R(t) + \Delta t\,\nu I(t) .
label{SIR1:R}
\end{align}
!et
These equations are a system of difference equations, as discussed in more detail 
in Appendix ref{ch:diff_eq}. We could easily solve the equations as such, using techniques from
Appendix ref{ch:diff_eq}, but it is even more convenient to formulate the model
as a system of ODEs and apply the ODE solvers derived in previous chapters. 

idx{difference equations ! SIR model}
To turn the difference equations into ODEs, we first divide all equations
by $\Delta t$ and rearrange, to get
!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{S(t+\Delta t) - S(t)}{\Delta t} &= - \beta \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N}, label{sir_diffeq0} \\
\frac{I(t+\Delta t) - I(t)}{\Delta t} &= \beta t \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N} -\nu I(t), label{sir_diffeq1} \\
\frac{R(t+\Delta t) - R(t)}{\Delta t} &= \nu I(t) . label{sir_diffeq2}
\end{align}
!et
We see that by letting $\Delta t\rightarrow 0$, we get
derivatives on the left-hand side:
!bt
\begin{align}
S'(t) &= - \beta \frac{S I}{N}, label{sir_ode0}\\
I'(t) &= \beta \frac{S I}{N} -\nu I  label{sir_ode1}\\
R'(t) &= \nu I label{sir_ode2},
\end{align}
!et
where, as above, $N=S+I+R$.[^sir0] If we add the three equations we see that
$N'(t) = S'(t)+I'(t)+R'(t)= 0$, so the total population $N$ is constant.
The equations (ref{sir_ode0})-(ref{sir_ode2}) is a system of three ODEs,
which we will solve for the unknown
functions $S(t)$, $I(t)$, $R(t)$. To solve the equations we need
to specify initial conditions $S(0)$ (many), $I(0)$ (few), and
$R(0)$ (=0), as well as the parameters $\beta$ and $\nu$.

For practical applications of the model, estimating the parameters is
usually a major challenge. We can estimate
$\nu$ from the fact that $1/\nu$ is the average recovery time for the disease,
which is usually possible to determine from early cases.
The infection rate $\beta$, on the other hand, lumps a lot of biological and
sociological factors into a single number, and it is usually very difficult to estimate for a new disease.
It depends both on the biology of the disease itself, essentially how infectious it is,
and on the interactions of the population. In a global pandemic the
behavior of the population varies between different countries, and it will typically
change with time, so $\beta$ must usually be adapted to different regions and different
phases of the disease outbreak.

idx{reproduction number}
Epidemiologists often refer to the basic reproduction number $R0$ of an epidemic,
which is the average number of new persons that an infected person infects.
The critical number is $R0 = 1$, since if $R0 < 1$ the epidemic will decline,
while for $R0 > 1$ it will grow exponentially. In the simple model considered here,
the relationship between $R0$ and $\beta$ is $R0 = \beta/\nu$, since $\beta$ measures
the number of disease transmissions per time, and  $1/\nu$ is the
mean duration of the infectious period. Be aware of the potential confusion between the
$R$ category of the SIR, in particular its initial value $R(0)$, and the basic reproduction
number $R0$. These quantities are not directly related, and the notation is obviously not optimal, 
but we use it here since it is very established in the field.

# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
[^sir0]: A simpler version of the SIR model is also quite common, where the disease transmission term
is not scaled with $N$. Eq. (ref{sir_ode1}) then reads $S' = - \beta S I$, and (ref{sir_ode1})
is modified similarly. Since $N$ is constant the two models are equivalent,
but the version in (ref{sir_ode0})-(ref{sir_ode2}) is more common in real-world applications
and gives a closer relation between $\beta$ and common parameters such as the reproduction number. 
# #endif

Although the system (ref{sir_ode0})-(ref{sir_ode2}) looks quite simple, analytical solutions
cannot easily be derived.  For particular applications
it is common to make simplifications that allow simple analytical solutions. For instance,
when studying the early phase of an epidemic one is mostly interested in the $I$
category, and since the number of infected cases in this phase is low compared with
the entire population we may assume that $S$ is approximately constant and equal to $N$.
Inserting $S\approx N$ turns (ref{sir_ode1}) into a simple equation describing exponential growth, with solution
!bt
\begin{equation}
I(t) = I_0 e^{(\beta -\nu)} .
\label{sir_exp0} \end{equation}
!et
Such an approximate formula may be very useful, in particular for estimating the
parameters of the model. In the early phase of an epidemic the number of infected
people typically follows an exponential curve, and we can fit the parameters of the model
so that (ref{sir_exp0}) fits the observed dynamics. We can also relate the behavior of
this simple model to the basic reproduction number $R0$ introduced above. We have 
$R0=\beta/\nu$, and therefore $R0>1$ makes the exponent of (ref{sir_exp0}) positive, while
for $R0<1$ the exponent is negative and $I(t)$ declines. However, if we want to describe the
full dynamics of the epidemic we need to solve the complete system of ODEs, and
then we need numerical solvers like the ones developed in the previous chapters. 

=== Solving the SIR model with the `ODESystem` class hierarchy. ===
idx{SIR model ! implementation}
We can easily solve the SIR model given (ref{sir_ode0})-(ref{sir_ode2}) using the
solver tools developed in the previous chapters. For typical parameter values the 
models are not stiff, and the explicit RK solvers work well. For instance, a simple code
which implements the SIR model as a function, and solves it using the fourth-order
RK method, may look as follows:
!bc pycod
from ODESolver import RungeKutta4
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def SIR_model(t,u):
    beta = 1.0
    nu = 1/7.0
    S, I, R = u[0], u[1], u[2]
    N = S+I+R
    dS = -beta*S*I/N
    dI = beta*S*I/N - nu*I
    dR = nu*I
    return [dS,dI,dR]

S0 = 1000
I0 = 1
R0 = 0

solver= RungeKutta4(SIR_model)
solver.set_initial_condition([S0,I0,R0])
time_points = np.linspace(0, 100, 1001)
t, u = solver.solve(time_points)
S = u[:,0];  I = u[:,1]; R = u[:,2]

plt.plot(t,S,t,I,t,R)
plt.show()
!ec
The resulting plot is shown in Figure ref{fig:sir_sol0}.

=== A class implementation of the SIR model. ===
idx{SIR model ! class implementation}
As noted above, estimating the parameters in the model is often challenging.
In fact, one of the most important application of models of this kind is to
predict the dynamics of new and unknown diseases, for instance during 
the global Covid19 pandemic. Accurate predictions of the number of disease 
cases can be extremely important in planning the response to the epidemic, 
but the challenge is that for a new disease all the parameters are largely unknown. 
There are ways to
estimate the parameters from the early disease dynamics, but the estimates will contain
a large degree of uncertainty, and a common strategy is then to run the
model for multiple parameter sets to get an idea of the different disease outbreak
scenarios that can be expected. We can easily run the code above for multiple values of
`beta` and `nu`, but it is inconvenient that both parameters are hardcoded as local
variables in the `SIR_model` function, so we need to edit the code for each new parameter value
we want. As we have seen earlier, it is much better to represent such a parameterized
function as a class, where the parameters can be set in the constructor and the
function itself is implemented in a `__call__` method. A class for the SIR model
could look like:
!bc pycod
class SIR:
    def __init__(self, beta, nu):
        self.beta = beta
        self.nu = nu

    def __call__(self,u,t):
        S, I, R = u[0], u[1], u[2]
        N = S+I+R
        dS = -self.beta*S*I/N
        dI = self.beta*S*I/N - self.nu*I
        dR = self.nu*I
        return [dS,dI,dR]

!ec
As for the models considered in earlier chapters, the use of the class is very similar to 
the use of the `SIR_model` function above. We create an instance of the class with given 
values of `beta` and `nu`, and then this instance can be passed to the ODE solver 
just as any regular Python function. 


FIGURE: [../chapters/figs_ch5/SIR_simple.pdf, width=800 frac=0.8] Solution of the simplest version of the SIR model, showing how the number of people in each category ($S,I$, and $R$) changes with time. label{fig:sir_sol0}



======= Extending the SIR model =======

The SIR model itself in its simplest form is rarely used for predictive simulations of real-world diseases,
but various extensions of the model are used to a large extent. Many such extensions
have been derived, in order to best fit the dynamics of different infectious diseases.
We will here consider a few such extensions, which are all based on the building
blocks of the simple SIR model.

=== A SIR model without life-long immunity. ===
idx{SIR model ! immunity}
One very simple modification of the model above is to remove the assumption of
life-long immunity. The model (ref{sir_ode0})-(ref{sir_ode2}) describes a one-directional
flux towards the R category, and if we solve the model for a sufficiently
long time interval the entire population will end up in R. This situation is not
realistic for many diseases, since immunity is often lost or reduced with time.
In the model this loss can be described by a leakage of people from the R category back
to S. If we introduce the parameter $\gamma$ to describe this flux
($1/\gamma$ being the mean time for immunity), the modified equation system looks like
!bt
\begin{align*}
S'(t) &= - \beta S I/N +\gamma R,\\
I'(t) &= \beta S I/N -\nu I,  \\
R'(t) &= \nu I -\gamma R.
\end{align*}
!et
As above, we see that the reduction in $R$ is matched by an increase in $S$ of
exactly the same magnitude. The total population $S+I+R$ remains constant.
The model can be implemented by a trivial extension of the `SIR` class shown above,
by simply adding one additional parameter to the constructor and the extra terms
in the `dS` and `dR` equations. Depending on the choice of the parameters, the model
may show far more interesting dynamics than the simplest SIR model. An example solution 
is shown in Figure ref{fig:sir_sol1}. Here, we set $\beta=0.001, \nu=1/7.0$, 
and $\gamma = 1.0/50$, thereby assuming that the mean duration of the disease is seven days
and the mean duration of immunity is 50 days. 

FIGURE: [../chapters/figs_ch5/SIR_immunity_loss.pdf, width=800 frac=0.8] Illustration of a SIR model without lifelong immunity, where people move from the R category back to S after a given time. label{fig:sir_sol1}

=== A SEIR model to capture the incubation period. ===
idx{SEIR model} idx{incubation period}
For many important infections, there is a significant incubation period during
which individuals have been infected, but they are not yet infectious themselves. To
capture these dynamics in the model, we may add a category E (for exposed). When people are infected they will then move
into the E category rather than directly to I, and then gradually move over
to the infected state where they can also infect others. The model for how susceptible
people get infected is kept exactly as in the ordinary SIR model. Such a SEIR model
is illustrated in Figure ref{fig:seir}, and the ODEs may look like
!bt
\begin{align*}
S'(t) &= - \beta S I/N +\gamma R,\\
E'(t) &= \beta S I/N - \mu E, \\
I'(t) &= \mu E -\nu I,  \\
R'(t) &= \nu I -\gamma R.
\end{align*}
!et
Notice that the overall structure of the model remains the same. Since the total population is conserved,
all terms are balanced in the sense that they occur twice in the model, with opposite signs. A decrease
in one category is always matched with an identical increase in another category. It is always useful
to be aware of such fundamental properties in a model, since they can easily be checked in the computed
solutions and may reveal errors in the implementation. 


FIGURE: [../chapters/figs_ch5/SEIR.pdf, width=800 frac=0.8] Illustration of the SEIR model, without life-long immunity.  label{fig:seir}


Again, this small extension of the model does not make it much more
difficult to solve. The following code shows an example of how the SEIR model
can be implemented as a class and solved with the `ODESolver` hierarchy:
!bc pycod
from ODESolver import RungeKutta4
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class SEIR:
    def __init__(self, beta, mu, nu, gamma):
        self.beta = beta
        self.mu = mu
        self.nu = nu
        self.gamma = gamma


    def __call__(self,u,t):
        S, E, I, R = u
        N = S+I+R+E
        dS = -self.beta*S*I/N + self.gamma*R
        dE  = self.beta*S*I/N - self.mu*E
        dI =  self.mu*E - self.nu*I
        dR = self.nu*I - self.gamma*R
        return [dS,dE,dI,dR]

S0 = 1000
E0 = 0
I0 = 1
R0 = 0
model = SEIR(beta=1.0, mu=1.0/5,nu=1.0/7,gamma=1.0/50)

solver= RungeKutta4(model)
solver.set_initial_condition([S0,E0,I0,R0])
time_points = np.linspace(0, 100, 101)
u, t = solver.solve(time_points)
S = u[:,0]; E = u[:,1]; I = u[:,2]; R = u[:,3]

plt.plot(t,S,t,E,t,I,t,R)
plt.show()
!ec

======= A model of the Covid19 pandemic =======
idx{SEEIR model} idx{Covid19}
The models considered above can be adapted to describe more complex
disease behavior by adding more categories of people and possibly more interactions
between the different categories. We will now consider an extension of the
SEIR model above into a model that was used by Norwegian health authorities
to predict the spread of the Covid19 pandemic through 2020 and 2021. We will here derive the model
as a system of ODEs, just like the models considered above, while the real
model that is used to provide Covid19 predictions for health authorities is a stochastic model.[^spread]
A stochastic model is somewhat more flexible than the deterministic ODE version,
and considers the inherent randomness and variability in disease transmission. 
The model assumes that disease transmission is a stochastic process, meaning that the 
probability of an individual getting infected is not fixed, but depends on random events 
and chance encounters with infected individuals. In a stochastic SIR model, the number of 
individuals in each compartment is modeled using probability distributions rather than 
deterministic equations, and transitions between compartments are modeled as stochastic
processes rather than a continuous flux described by ODEs. One advantage of stochastic models
is that one can more easily incorporate dynamics such as model parameters that vary with
time after infection. For instance, the infectiousness ($\beta$) should typically
follow a bell-shaped curve that increases gradually after infection, reaches a peak after
a few days, and is then reduced. Such behavior is easier to incorporate in a stochastic
model than in the deterministic ODE model considered here, which
essentially assumes a constant $\beta$ for everyone in the $I$ category. However,
the overall structure and dynamics of the two model types are exactly the same, and
for certain choices of the model parameters the stochastic and deterministic
models become equivalent. See, for instance, cite{Greenwood2009} for a discussion of stochastic
and deterministic epidemiology models.

# #endif

An important characteristic of Covid19 is that people may be infected, and able to infect others, 
even if they experience no symptoms. This property obviously has a massive impact on 
the disease spread, since people are unaware that they are infected and therefore take no 
precautions against infecting others. Two separate groups of asymptomatic yet infectious people
have been identified:
 * A certain number of people are infected, but never develop any symptoms, or the symptoms are so 
   mild that they are mistaken for other mild airway infections. These asymptomatic
   people can still infect other, but with a lower infectiousness than the symptomatic group, and
   they need to be treated as a separate category.
 * The other group, which is probably even more important for the disease dynamics, consist of people
   who are infected and will develop symptoms, but the symptoms have not developed yet. They are, however, 
   still able to infect others, unlike the people in the *exposed* ($E$) category of the simple SEIR model above. 
   
These two groups can be modeled by adding to new compartments to the SEIR model introduced
earlier. We split the exposed category in two, $E_1$ and $E_2$, with the first being non-infectious and
the second being able to infect others. The $I$ category is also divided in two; a symptomatic $I$
and an asymptomatic $I_a$. The flux from $S$ to $E_1$ will be similar to the SEIR model, but from $E_1$
people will follow one of two possible trajectories. Some will move on to $E_2$ and then
into $I$ and finally $R$, while others move directly into $I_a$ and then to $R$.
The model is illustrated in Figure ref{fig:covid19}. Since there are two different $E$-categories
and two different $I$-categories, we refer to the model as a SEEIIR model. 

FIGURE: [../chapters/figs_ch5/SEEIIR.pdf, width=800 frac=0.8] Illustration of the Covid19 epidemic model, with two alternative disease trajectories. label{fig:covid19}

The derivation of the model equations is similar to the simpler models
considered above, but there will be more equations as well as more terms in each equation.
The most important extension from the models above is that the SEEIIR model has
three categories of infectious people; $E_2, I$, and $I_a$. All of these
interact with the $S$ category to create new infections, and we model each
of these interactions exactly as we did above. In a time
interval $\Delta t$, we have the following three contributions to the flux from
$S$ to $E_1$:
* Infected by people in $I$: $\beta  \Delta tSI/N$.
* Infected by people in $I_a$: $r_{ia} \beta \Delta t  S I_a/N $
* Infected by people in $E_2$: $r_{e2} \beta \Delta t  S E_2/N $
We allow the infectiousness to be different between the three categories,
incorporated through a main infectiousness parameter $\beta$ and
two parameters $r_{ia}, r_{e2}$ that scale the infectiousness for the two respective groups.
Considering all three contributions, and following the same steps as above
to construct a difference equation and then an ODE, we get the following equation
for the $S$ category:
!bt
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta \frac{SI}{N}- r_{ia} \beta \frac{S I_a}{N} - r_{e2} \beta \frac{S E_2}{N}.
\end{equation}
!et
When people get infected they move from $S$ to $E_1$, so the same three terms
must appear in the equation for $E_1$, with opposite signs. Furthermore,
people in $E_1$ will move either to $E_2$ or $I_a$. We have
!bt
\begin{align*}
    \frac{dE_1}{dt} & = \beta \frac{S I}{N} + r_{ia} \beta \frac{S I_a}{N} + r_{e2} \beta \frac{S E_2}{N}
    - \lambda_1(1-p_a)E_1 - \lambda_1 p_a E_1 \nonumber \\
    & = \beta \frac{S I}{N} + r_{ia} \beta \frac{S I_a}{N} + r_{e2} \beta \frac{S E_2}{N} - \lambda_1 E_1.
\end{align*}
!et
Here, $p_a$ is a parameter describing the proportion of infected people that never develop symptoms, while
$1/\lambda_1$ is the mean duration of the non-infectious incubation period. The term $\lambda_1(1-p_a)E_1$
represents people moving to $E_2$, and $\lambda_1p_aE_1$ are people moving to $I_a$.
 In the equation for
$E_1$ we can combine these two fluxes into a single term, but they must be considered
separately in the equations for $E_2$ and $I_a$.

Moving to the next step in Figure ref{fig:covid19}, we need to consider the two trajectories separately. 
Starting with the people that develop symptoms, the $E_2$ compartment will get an influx of people from $E_1$, and an outflux of 
people moving on to the infected $I$ category, while $I$ gets an influx from $E_2$ and an outflux to $R$. The ODEs for
these two categories become
!bt
\begin{align*}
    \frac{dE_2}{dt} &= \lambda_1(1-p_a)E_1 - \lambda_2E_2, \\
    \frac{dI}{t} &= \lambda_2E_2 - \mu I,
\end{align*}
!et
where $1/\lambda_2$ and $1/\mu$ are the mean durations of the $E_2$ and $I$ phases, respectively.
The model for the asymptomatic disease trajectory is somewhat simpler, with $I_a$ receiving an
influx from $E_1$ and losing people directly to $R$. We have
!bt
\[
    \frac{dI_a}{dt} = \lambda_1  p_a E_1 - \mu I_a,
\]
!et
where we have assumed that the duration of the $I_a$ period is the same as for $I$, i.e. $1/\mu$.
Finally, the dynamics of the recovered category are governed by
!bt
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = \mu I + \mu I_a.
\]
!et
Notice that we do not consider flow from the $R$ category back to $S$, so
we have effectively assumed life-long immunity. This assumption is not correct
for Covid19, but in the early phase of the pandemic the duration of immunity was largely unknown, 
and the loss of immunity was therefore not considered in the models. 

idx{SEEIR model ! ODE system}
To summarize, the complete ODE system of the SEEIIR model can be written as
!bt
\begin{align*}

A suitable choice of default parameters  for the model can be as follows:
|--l-----------------l----------------|
|Parameter     | Value                |
|---l----------------r----------------|
| $\beta$      | 0.33  |
| $r_{ia}$     | 0.1                  |
| $r_{e2}$     | 1.25                 |
| $\lambda_1$  | 0.33                 |
| $\lambda_2$  | 0.5                  |
| $p_a$        | 0.4                  |
| $\mu$        | 0.2                  |
|-------------------------------------|
These parameters are similar to the ones used by the health authorities to model
the early phase of the Covid19 outbreak in Norway. At this time the behavior of 
the disease was largely unknown, and it was also difficult to estimate the number of 
disease cases in the population. It was therefore challenging to 
fit the parameter values, and they were all associated with considerable 
uncertainty. As mentioned earlier, the hardest parameters to estimate are the
ones related to infectiousness and disease spread, which in the present model 
are $\beta, r_{ia}$, and $r_{e2}$. These have been updated many times through the
course of the pandemic, both to reflect new knowledge about the disease and actual
changes in disease spread caused by new mutations or changes in the behavior 
of the population. Notice that we have set $r_{e2} >1$, which means that people
in the $E_2$ category are more infectious than the infected group in $I$. This assumption
reflects the fact that the $E_2$ group is asymptomatic, so people in this group are
expected to move around more and therefore potentially infect more people than the $I$
group. The $I_a$ group, on the other hand, is also  asymptomatic and therefore likely to
have normal social interactions, but it is assumed that these people have a 
very low virus count. They are therefore less infectious than the people that 
develop symptoms, which is reflected in the low value of $r_{ia}$.

The parameters $\mu, \lambda_1$, and $\lambda_2$ are given in units of days$^{-1}$,
so the mean duration of the symptomatic disease period is five days ($1/\mu$),
the non-infectious incubation period lasts three days on average ($1/\lambda_1$), while the
mean duration of the infectious incubation period ($E_2$) is two days ($1/\lambda_2$). In the present model, 
which has multiple infectious categories, the basic reproduction number is given by
\[
R0 = r_{e2}\beta/\lambda_2 + r_{ia}\beta/\mu + \beta/\mu,
\]
since the mean durations of the $E_2$ period is $1/\lambda_2$ and the mean duration
of both $I$ and $Ia$ is $1/\mu$. The parameter choices listed above gives $R0 \approx 2.62$, which
is the value used by the Institute of Public Health (FHI) to model the early
stage of the outbreak in Norway, from mid-February to mid-March 2020.

idx{SEEIIR model ! class implementation}
Although the present model is somewhat more complex than the previous ones, the 
implementation is not very different. A class implementation may look as follows:
!bc pycod
class SEEIIR:
    def __init__(self, beta=0.33, r_ia=0.1,
                 r_e2=1.25, lmbda_1=0.33,
                 lmbda_2=0.5, p_a=0.4, mu=0.2):

        self.beta = beta
        self.r_ia = r_ia
        self.r_e2 = r_e2
        self.lmbda_1 = lmbda_1
        self.lmbda_2 = lmbda_2
        self.p_a = p_a
        self.mu = mu

    def __call__(self, t, u):
        beta = self.beta
        r_ia = self.r_ia
        r_e2 = self.r_e2
        lmbda_1 = self.lmbda_1
        lmbda_2 = self.lmbda_2
        p_a = self.p_a
        mu = self.mu

        S, E1, E2, I, Ia, R = u
        N = sum(u)
        dS = -beta * S * I / N - r_ia * beta * S * Ia / N \
            - r_e2 * beta * S * E2 / N
        dE1 = beta * S * I / N + r_ia * beta * S * Ia / N \
            + r_e2 * beta * S * E2 / N - lmbda_1 * E1
        dE2 = lmbda_1 * (1 - p_a) * E1 - lmbda_2 * E2
        dI = lmbda_2 * E2 - mu * I
        dIa = lmbda_1 * p_a * E1 - mu * Ia
        dR = mu * (I + Ia)
        return [dS, dE1, dE2, dI, dIa, dR]

The model can be solved with any of the methods in the `ODESolver` hierarchy, just as the
simpler models considered earlier. An example solution with the default parameter values
is shown in Figure ref{fig:seeiir0}. Since the parameters listed above are based on the
very first stage of the pandemic, when no restrictions were in place, this solution 
may be interpreted as a potential worst case scenario for the pandemic in Norway
if no restrictions were imposed by the government. While the plot for the $I$ category does 
not look too dramatic, a closer inspection reveals that the peak is at just above 140,000 
people. Considering what was known, and, more importantly, what was not known, about the
severity of Covid19 at that stage, it is not surprising that a scenario of 140,000
people being infected simultaneously caused some alarm with the health authorities. 
Another interesting observation from the curve is that the $S$ category flattens out
well below the total population number. This behavior is an example of so-called herd immunity,
that when a sufficient number of people are immune to the disease, it will effectively stop spreading
even if a large number of people are still susceptible. As we all know, severe restrictions were 
put in place in most countries during the early spring of 2020, which makes it impossible to 
know whether this worst case scenario would ever materialize. 
If we want to match the actual dynamics of the pandemic
in Norway, we would need to incorporate the effect of societal changes and altered infectiousness
by making the $\beta$ parameter a function of time. For instance, we can define it as
a piecewise constant function to match the reproduction numbers estimated and published by the health authorities.
