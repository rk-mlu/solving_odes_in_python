    "# Modelling infectious diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this book we have focused entirely on *solving* ODEs, and\n",
    "we have not spent much time considering the origin of the equations or\n",
    "what they may be used for. In the present chapter we focus on  \n",
    "*modeling* with ODEs, by considering a very famous and widely used class\n",
    "of ODE models that describe the spread of infectious diseases. \n",
    "This group of models provides a good example of how a very complex phenomenon\n",
    "can be modeled with relatively simple systems of ODEs. We will derive the\n",
    "models from a set of fundamental assumptions, and discuss the limitations\n",
    "that result from these assumptions. Although we only consider one phenomenon \n",
    "and one class of models, the fundamental steps of the modeling process are\n",
    "quite generic, and can be applicable for a wide range of real-world phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Derivation of the SIR model\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to model how infectious diseases spread in a population. This is a topic \n",
    "of obvious scientific and societal interest, which has been studied by scientists\n",
    "for centuries and, for obvious reasons, received enormous attention in recent years. \n",
    "The classical model for predicting the dynamics of an epidemic was derived \n",
    "by Kermack and McKendrick [[SIR1]](#SIR1) in the early 1900s, and is referred to as the SIR model,\n",
    "since it describes the three categories Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (or, alternatively, Removed). \n",
    "The spread of disease in a population is a very complex process, and in order to derive \n",
    "an ODE based model we need to make a number of simplifying assumptions. The\n",
    "most important one is that we do not consider individuals, just the total population\n",
    "and the number of people that move between the three categories. The\n",
    "population is assumed to be perfectly mixed in a confined area, which means that we\n",
    "do not consider spatial transport of the disease, just temporal evolution. The first\n",
    "model we will derive is very simple, but we shall see that it can easily be extended to\n",
    "models that are used world-wide by health authorities to predict the\n",
    "spread of diseases such as Covid19, flu, ebola, HIV, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first version of the model we will keep track of the three categories of people\n",
    "mentioned above:\n",
    " * **S**: susceptibles - who can get the disease\n",
    "\n",
    " * **I**: infected - who have developed the disease and can infect susceptibles\n",
    "\n",
    " * **R**: recovered - who have recovered and become immune\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent these as mathematical quantities\n",
    "$S(t)$, $I(t)$, $R(t)$,  which represent the number of people in each category.\n",
    "The goal is now to derive a set of equations for $S(t)$, $I(t)$, $R(t)$, and then\n",
    "solve these equations to predict the spread of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the model equations, we first consider the dynamics in a time interval\n",
    "$\\Delta t$, and our goal is to derive mathematical expressions for how many\n",
    "people that move between the three categories in this time interval. The key part of\n",
    "the model is the description of how people move from $S$ to $I$, i.e., how\n",
    "susceptible individuals get the infection from those already infected.\n",
    "Infectious diseases are (mainly) transferred by direct interactions between\n",
    "people, so we need mathematical descriptions of the number of interactions\n",
    "between susceptible and infected individuals. We make the following assumptions:\n",
    "* An individual in the $S$ category interacts with an approximately constant\n",
    "  number of people each day, so the number of interactions in a\n",
    "  time interval $\\Delta t$ is proportional to $\\Delta t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of one of these interactions being with an infected person is\n",
    "  proportional to the ratio of infected individuals to the total population, i.e.,\n",
    "  to $I/N$, with $N=S+I+R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these assumptions, the probability that a single susceptible person\n",
    "gets infected is proportional to $\\Delta t I/N$. The total number of\n",
    "infections can be written as $\\beta SI/N$, for some constant $\\beta$. The infection\n",
    "of new individuals represents a reduction in $S$ and a corresponding gain in $I$: , so we have"

    "SEIR model above into a model that was used by Norwegian health authorities\n",
    "to predict the spread of the Covid19 pandemic through 2020 and 2021. We will here derive the model\n",

    "A stochastic model is somewhat more flexible than the deterministic ODE version,\n",

    "The model assumes that disease transmission is a stochastic process, meaning that the \n",

    "and chance encounters with infected individuals. In a stochastic SIR model, the number of \n",
    "individuals in each compartment is modeled using probability distributions rather than \n",
    "deterministic equations, and transitions between compartments are modeled as stochastic\n",
    "processes rather than a continuous flux described by ODEs. One advantage of stochastic models\n",
    "is that one can more easily incorporate dynamics such as model parameters that vary with\n",
    "time after infection. For instance, the infectiousness ($\\beta$) should typically\n",
